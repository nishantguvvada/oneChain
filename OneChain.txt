OneChain: an application that takes as input a list of emails and a backend news API and triggers sending newsletter to the email list.

BACKEND: 

1. Backend News API (pre-built)
2. Send newsletters to emails in a list

FRONTEND:

1. Landing Page with an option to input email and a button to subscribe
2. newsletter in HTML

MailChimp API Key: MYRPS7557R03091996

1st Draft:

- Create a backend to read the news from the News API - Done
- Create a frontend to render the news from the backend - Done
Issue 1: map not a function => first set the useState as an array, axios response needs to be awaited further, props not to be destructured in a new component
Issue 2: to add a variable to a property of an element, use {`http://abc${addwhatever}`}
- Create a script to convert the frontend to htmlstring - Done
- Create a script to perform mail distribution using MailChimp

In Mailchimp, a contact only exists in the context of the audience it’s a member of. You can’t create a contact and then later add that contact to a list—which means contacts can’t be explicitly shared between more than one list.
